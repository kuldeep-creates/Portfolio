# Personal Portfolio Website

This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio, built from scratch using React. The purpose of this project is to showcase my skills, projects, and provide a point of contact.

## üöÄ Project Overview

*   **Hero Section:** An advanced, engaging introduction.
*   **About Me:** A detailed section about my background and skills.
*   **Projects:** A showcase of my work.
*   **Skills:** A list of my technical proficiencies.
*   **Contact:** A form or information to get in touch.

The application also includes separate, dedicated pages for a **LeetCode activity explorer**, a **CodeForces profile page**, and individual **project detail pages**.

*   **Core:** React, React Router
*   **Styling:** CSS3 (with custom animations and responsive design)
